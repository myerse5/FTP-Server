This file will appear in the root directory of the FTP server.

A different root directory for the server can be specified in the file
"FTP-Server/config/ftp.conf".

Users connected to the server will not be able to access any parent of this
directory by using paths which include "..", "~/", etc. Symbolic links are
also expanded and checked, and may not be used to access files that are not a
descendant of the root directory of the server.
