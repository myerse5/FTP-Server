/******************************************************************************
 * This function merges the three path fragments into a single pathname. This
 * value is used by a command function, eg. RETR, to find the pathname to the
 * requested file. 
 *
 * The locations and purpose of each pathname:
 *
 *   -rootdir: A global variable. Stores the path to the root directory
 *             selected by the server. This value is set in the file 'ftp.conf'.
 *
 *   -cwd:     The current working directory for the client session. This is a
 *             relative pathname to rootdir, and can be found in session_info_t.
 *
 *    argpath: This is the pathname supplied as an argument by the client. This
 *             string is relative to the current working directory found above.
 *             This value is discarded when a command thread no longer requires
 *             it.

 * Note: The string returned by this function was created with a call to malloc.
 *       The caller function must be sure to free this memory.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *      cwd - The current working directory string as described above.
 *
 *  argpath - The pathname argument received from the client as described above.
 *
 *  reserve - When checking if a file may be created on the server
 *            (eg. the STOR command), it is necessary to remove the filename
 *            that does not yet exist from the filepath before calling the
 *            function canonicalize_file_name(). In this case, the argpath
 *            string may be "trimmed" of the non-existent file before calling
 *            this function. The string returned by this function will contain
 *            "reserve" amount of indexes so the trimmed file may later be
 *            re-attached to the pathname.
 *
 *            NULL can be passed to this argument if no space needs to be
 *            reserved.
 *
 * Return value:
 *   string - The full pathname to the argument (rootdir -> cwd -> argument).
 *     NULL - Error
